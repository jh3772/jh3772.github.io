        <h2>Intro Paragraph</h2>
        <p>This webste is all about myself. I'm Jay and I'm currently
            on this plane flying over to my homecountry South Korea.
            12 hour flights are painfully boring so why not do my coding homework.
            I have zero clue how to make a good looking paragraph
            so it's just a really lo line of word but Victor can always
            teach me how to do it so yeah enjoy></p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I'm a grade 9 student who goes to this jailcell called Prince of Wales secondary school.
            However, I barely learn anything at school so this paragraph
            is all about my tutors and whatever. I take English, math/science, ACT, coding,leadership,
            and basketball classes outside school.
            Soon i will have to tke more and more classes.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I don't really have a "hobby" but I do like to do bunch of things
            when I have some free time. I'm usually on my phone or laptop
            texting or calling my friends and I always listen to music o matter what.
            I also like to go on my Facebook buy or sell group and maybe buy something.
            I love to go out with my friends and take photos or just chill somewhere.
            I do love to play basketball but I barely have any time on week days to
            do anything I like to do eexceot texting or whatever I can do on my phone.
